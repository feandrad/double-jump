# PassingGas Mod
### How to fart in Minecraft:
- Get Cabbage Seeds from wherever you can get Wheat Seeds
- Plant and grow a cabbage
- Eating a cabbage gives you Flatulence
- You fart periodically while you have the effect on you. Sneaking makes you fart more frequently

### Potion of Flatulence
-Brew Cabbage and Akward Potion
-Add gunpowder to brew the throwable version (most of the fun lies here)
-Longer Flatulence duration compared with just eating the cabbage

### Possible Enchancements
- Mobs look at you when you fart (can generate aggro)
- Sniffers flee from you when you have the Flatulence effect on and make sounds when you fart
- Warden really don't like Farts
- Farts triggers Skulk sensors
